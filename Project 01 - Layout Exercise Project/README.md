# Layout-Exercise-Project
This is the first project about layouts Upchool gave us. 

I made a few desings close to original by creating style and font files. Also i applied data binding into this project.
(After the design was made, the screen sizes were rearranged according to the emulator in the project.)

Here are the layout designs i did.
